# Alberta-Press-Questions
Tracking of which reporters get to ask questions during Alberta press conferences -- heavily focused on Covid-19 press conferences.

Caveats: 
1) This data set is not inclusive of all the press conferences that have occured during the period, and should be 
treated like a sampling of data rather than a full compendium.

2) ?[NAME]? for reporters and columnists indicates that the correct spelling of the individual's name has not been checked.

3) Clock times are either from the start time of the question, indicated by repeated 0:00.00 during a press event, or the running time between questions.
